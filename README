This file goes trough how you can run the tasks in repository.

Extracted queries are at .json files "Query1.json" and "Query2.json"
queries.py requires dataset to be downloaded at the computer. As the dataset is large, I suggest just looking at the code without running it.

Tasks can be runned if they are in the same folder as queries. In task 9 you need to have same folder structure as specified in row 7, as filepath to used table.
stopwords.txt is list of stopwords extracted from the queries. You need to have it loaded and saved at the same folder to run tasks 7-9
